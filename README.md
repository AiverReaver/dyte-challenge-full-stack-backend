# Awesome Project Build with TypeORM

Steps to run this project:

1. Run `npm i` command
2. Setup database settings inside `ormconfig.json` file
3. Rename `.env.development.example` to `.env.development` and changes values to env variables according to your need
4. Run `npm run start:dev` command (For some reason this command gives error in git bash and cmd. I would recommend using linux or macos termnal or WSL in windows)
